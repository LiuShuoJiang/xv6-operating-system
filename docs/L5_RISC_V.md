# Lecture 5: RISC-V Calling Convention, Stack Frames, and GDB

## C Code Compilation

- C code is compiled to machine instructions.
  - How does the machine work at a lower level?
  - How does this translation work?
  - How to interact between C and assembly?
  - Why this matters: sometimes need to write code not expressible in C.
  - You need this for the syscall lab!

## RISC-V Abstract Machine

- No C-like control flow, no concept of variables, types, etc.
- Base ISA: Program counter, 32 general-purpose registers (`x0`--`x31`).

| reg  | name  | saver  | description                |
|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:----------------------------:|
| `x0`  | `zero`  |        | hardwired zero             |
| `x1` | `ra`    | caller | return address             |
| `x2`   | `sp`    | callee | stack pointer              |
| `x3`   | `gp`    |        | global pointer             |
| `x4`  | `tp`    |        | thread pointer             |
| `x5-7` | `t0-2`  | caller | temporary registers        |
| `x8`   | `s0/fp` | callee | saved register / frame pointer |
| `x9`   | `s1`    | callee | saved register             |
| `x10-11` | `a0-1` | caller | function arguments / return values |
| `x12-17` | `a2-7` | caller | function arguments         |
| `x18-27` | `s2-11` | callee | saved registers            |
| `x28-31` | `t3-6` | caller | temporary registers        |
| `pc`   |       |        | program counter            |

### Running Example: `sum_to(n)`

```c
int sum_to(int n) {
  int acc = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    acc += i;
  }
  return acc;
}
```

### Assembly Code

What does this look like in assembly code?

```assembly
# sum_to(n)
# expects argument in a0
# returns result in a0
sum_to:
  mv t0, a0          # t0 <- a0
  li a0, 0           # a0 <- 0
loop:
  add a0, a0, t0     # a0 <- a0 + t0
  addi t0, t0, -1    # t0 <- t0 - 1
  bnez t0, loop      # if t0 != 0: pc <- loop
  ret
```

### Limited Abstractions

- No typed, positional arguments.
- No local variables.
- Only registers.

### Machine Instruction Encoding

- Machine doesn't even see assembly code.
- Sees binary encoding of machine instructions.
  - Each instruction: 16 bits or 32 bits.
  - E.g., `mv t0, a0` is encoded as 0x82aa.
  - Not quite 1-to-1 encoding from assembly, but close.

### Function Call Example

How would another function call `sum_to`?

```assembly
main:
  li a0, 10          # a0 <- 10
  call sum_to
```

### Semantics of `call`

```assembly
call label :=
  ra <- pc + 4       ; ra <- address of next instruction
  pc <- label        ; jump to label
```

Machine doesn't understand labels:

- Translated to either pc-relative or absolute jumps

### Semantics of `ret`

```assembly
ret :=
  pc <- ra
```

## GDB Demo: demo1.S

```bash
(gdb) file user/_demo1
(gdb) break main
(gdb) continue
# Why does it stop before running demo1?
(gdb) layout split
(gdb) stepi
(gdb) info registers
(gdb) p $a0
(gdb) advance 18
(gdb) si
(gdb) p $a0
```

### Calling Another Function Example

```assembly
# sum_then_double(n)
# expects argument in a0
# returns result in a0
sum_then_double:
  call sum_to
  li t0, 2           # t0 <- 2
  mul a0, a0, t0     # a0 <- a0 * t0
  ret

main:
  li a0, 10
  call sum_then_double
```

### Infinite Loop Issue

- We get stuck in an infinite loop.
- Why: overwrote return address (`ra`).

### Fixing the Infinite Loop

How to fix: save `ra` somewhere

- In another register? Won't work, just defers problem.
- Solution: save on **stack**

```assembly
sum_then_double:
  addi sp, sp, 16    # function prologue:
  sd ra, 0(sp)       # make space on stack, save registers
  call sum_to
  li t0, 2
  mul a0, a0, t0
  ld ra, 0(sp)       # function epilogue:
  addi sp, sp, -16   # restore registers, restore stack pointer
  ret
```

### GDB Demo: demo3.S

```bash
(gdb) ...
(gdb) nexti
```

## Function Coordination and Calling Convention

- So far, our functions coordinated with each other.
  - This worked because we were writing all the code involved.
  - Could have written it any other way.
    - E.g., passing arguments in `t2`, getting return value in `t3`.

### Calling Convention

- How are arguments passed?
  - `a0`, `a1`, ..., `a7`, rest on stack.
- How are values returned?
  - `a0`, `a1`.
- Who saves registers?
  - Designated as caller or callee saved.
  - Could ra be a callee-saved register?
- Our assembly code should follow this convention.
- C code generated by GCC follows this convention.
  - This means that everyone's code can interoperate, including C/assembly interop.

### Example: demo4.c / demo4.asm

- Can see function prologue, body, epilogue.
- Why doesn't it save `ra`? Leaf function, not needed.
- What is going on with `s0/fp`?
  - We compiled with `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`.

```text
          0x2fe0 |
          0x2fd8 | <garbage ra>       \
          0x2fd0 | <garbage fp>       / stack frame for main
          0x2fc8 | ra into main       \
  $fp --> 0x2fc0 | 0x0000000000002fe0 / stack frame for f
          0x2fb8 | ra into f          \
  $sp --> 0x2fb0 | 0x0000000000002fd0 / stack frame for g
```

### Automating Reasoning with GDB

GDB can automate this reasoning for us

- Plus, it can use debug info to reason about leaf functions, etc.

```bash
(gdb) backtrace
(gdb) info frame
(gdb) frame 1
(gdb) info frame
(gdb) frame 2
(gdb) info frame
```

## Calling C from Assembly and Vice Versa

- Follow calling convention and everything will work out.
- Write function prototype so C knows how to call assembly.

### Example: demo6.c / demo6_asm.S

- Why do we use s0/s1 instead of, e.g., t0/t1?

```bash
(gdb) b sum_squares_to
(gdb) si ...
(gdb) x/4g $sp
(gdb) si ...
```

## Inline Assembly

## Structs

- C struct layout rules.
  - Why: misaligned load/store can be slow or unsupported (platform-dependent).
  - `__attribute__((packed))`.
- How to access and manipulate C structs from assembly?
  - Generally passed by reference.
  - Need to know struct layout.
- Example: demo7.c / demo7_asm.S.

## Debugging with GDB

- `examine`: inspect memory contents.
  - `x/nfu addr`
    - `n`: count.
    - `f`: format.
    - `u`: unit size.
- `step/next/finish`
  - `step`: next line of C code.
  - `next`: next line of C code, skipping over function calls.
  - `finish`: continue executing until end of current function call.
- `stepi/nexti`
  - `stepi`: next assembly instruction.
  - `nexti`: next assembly instruction, skipping over function calls.
- `layout next`
  - Steps through layouts.
- Conditional breakpoints.
  - Break, only when a condition holds (e.g., variable has a certain value).
- Watchpoints.
  - Break when a memory location changes value.

### GDB is a Very Powerful Tool

- Read the manual for more!
- But you probably don't need all the fancy features for this class.
